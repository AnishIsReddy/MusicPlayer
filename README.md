# MusicPlayerTemp

WIP

Currently is a python script that can download a playlist on youtube and save it to a local drive
Also has a crude html page to play music (works fine on windows but has bugs on iOS due to webkit)

Improvements/Ideas:
- Better backend
- Support multiple playlists
- Fix webpage to work on iOS OR automatically upload playlists to an app
- Support downloading playlist from other music platforms (spotify, youtube music, etc.)
